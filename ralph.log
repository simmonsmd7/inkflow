Category: A (Bug Hunting)
Pages Checked: /commissions, /commissions (Pay Periods tab)
Issues Found: 1
Issues Fixed:
- Fixed UUID routing bug in backend commissions router - /pay-periods/unassigned endpoint was defined after /pay-periods/{pay_period_id}, causing FastAPI to match "unassigned" as a UUID parameter. Moved static route before dynamic route.
Status: IMPROVED
Next Suggestion: Continue testing dashboard cards and navigation
